This is a fork of Ian Bicking's `doctest2`_ repository. After reading his `blog
post about doctest.js`_, I was inspired to dive in and start looking for ways I
could help. I think doctest is one of Python's greatest features, but I agree
with Ian that there are many wrinkles and warts.

I figured I'd start with some test-driven development, by first writing some
doctests the way I would like them to work (in the ``tests`` directory), then
implementing them. I'll be referring to the list of `issues`_ that Ian created,
but may come up with other improvements as I go along.

I'll see how far I can get on my own, but I would welcome any assistance. I plan
to keep an eye on any forks of Ian's project, to avoid any duplication of
effort.
